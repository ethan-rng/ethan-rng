My name is Ethan Rong and I am a 3rd year CS 💻/business 📈 student from the University of Western Ontario 🟪⬜. My primary interests reside in applications of machine learning 🤖 and backend design including API design and I am always eager to take on a new challenge!

## 🛠  Languages and Skills
<p>
 I've primarily work with Python libraries such as pandas 🐼, numpy 🔢 and Flask ⚗️, but have dabbled in front-end JS libraries such as React 😮 and tailwind. On top of Python and JS, I've also coded with Java in my school 🏫 work and in my internship at the Ontario government.
